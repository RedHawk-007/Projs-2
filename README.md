This repository contains two proof-of-concept projects aligned with Replit's mission to make software creation more accessible.

## Projects
1. **RefactorAI:** AI-powered developer tool to refactor and enhance code quality.  
2. **Threat Detection Using CV** Threat detection and automating, optimizing surveillance operations with computer vision

Each project will showcase my approach to shipping production-ready features, problem-solving, and integrating AI tools into developer workflows.
